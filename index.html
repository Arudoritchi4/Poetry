            <strong>"My Moon, My Light" 🌙</strong> <br><br>

            You're the <strong>moon</strong> that guards my night, <br>
            My <strong>guiding light</strong>, so soft, so bright. <br>
            Through endless dark, you pull me near, <br>
            A <strong>radiant star</strong>, my heart holds dear. <br><br>

            The night may whisper winds so cold, <br>
            Yet in your arms, <em>the stars unfold.</em> <br>
            A warmth so rare, like golden streams, <br>
            You color life, my sweetest dream. <br><br>

            Beneath the sky, where wishes roam, <br>
            You shine like <strong>gold</strong>, my heart’s true home. <br>
            Like moonlit waves that kiss the shore, <br>
            I crave your love, <em>forevermore.</em> <br><br>

            The universe hums a song so true, <br>
            Every lyric whispers <strong>you</strong>. <br>
            With every breath, with every sigh, <br>
            You are my heart, my endless sky. <br><br>

            When storms arrive and nights turn long, <br>
            I'll be your shelter, safe and strong. <br>
            Through time and space, through sky so blue, <br>
            I’ll chase the stars <em>to stay with you.</em> <br><br>

            With you, my sky is <strong>painted whole</strong>, <br>
            A universe where my heart’s <strong>soul</strong> <br>
            Finds warmth, finds peace, finds something new— <br>
            For in this world, <em>there's only you.</em> ✨💝 <br><br>

            I’m sorry for making you cry, <br>
            Now my heart has found its sky. <br>
            Each word, a star I’ve drawn tonight, <br>
            To show <strong>how much you are my light.💖🌕</strong>
